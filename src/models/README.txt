Whilst every effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the models, their
accuracy is not guaranteed.

Finding a reputable paper to source these models from took a while. There was
lots of bad copy-paste out there. A good paper:

V. S. Abhayawardhana, I. J. Wassell, D. Crosby, M. P. Sellars and M. G. Brown, "Comparison of empirical propagation path loss models for fixed wireless access systems," 2005 IEEE 61st Vehicular Technology Conference, Stockholm, Sweden, 2005, pp. 73-77 Vol. 1, doi: 10.1109/VETECS.2005.1543252. keywords: {Propagation losses;Predictive models;Dispersion;Stochastic processes;Electromagnetic propagation;Antennas and propagation;Antenna measurements;Knowledge engineering;Interference;Electromagnetic measurements}, http://web.archive.org/web/20101225211748/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/lce-pub/public/vsa23/VTC05_Empirical.pdf
